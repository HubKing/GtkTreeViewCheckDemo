# GtkTreeViewCheckDemo
GTK# lacks documentation. It is painful to figure out how to do things in GTK# by searching the Internet and try to translate the answers/codes that are written in other languages. I have suffered to make checkbox work in GTK# GtkTreeView, so I would like to share my test project. I hope this could someday save someone's time.
